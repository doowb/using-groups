## tl;dr;

This is an example on using [assemble-permalinks][] and grouped collections from [templates][] to dynamically create view collections based on front-matter.

## Install

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/doowb/using-groups.git && cd using-groups && npm i
```

There's a post install script that should install the `jonschlinkert/templates#groups` branch.

## Run

To run the `dev` build, run the following command:

```sh
$ assemble dev
```

This will build the html, watch source files, and server the `_gh_pages` directory through [browser-sync][].

To only build the html, run the following command:

```sh
$ assemble
```

This should build to the `_gh_pages` directory with page content files going to the root and post content files going to the blog folder in sub-directories based on the date in their filename.

There are also `tags` and `categories` directories built out based on the front-matter found in the posts.

## Other

The blog posts found in this repository were converted from [the bootstrap blog](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-blog/tree/gh-pages/_posts). Front-matter was modified for example purposes.

The layout structure and css assets have been modified from [the bootstrap blog example](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/docs/examples/blog).
